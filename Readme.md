was thinking of doing rock-paper-scissors as a card game and wanted to make it so, as you win, you can unlock other visuals for the game.
hammer-knife-sword-shield-spear
hammer>shield/spear
knife>shield/hammer
sword>knife/hammer
shield>spear/sword
spear>sword/knife

select card (can deselect card if changed mind)
press fight to compare cards
allow for choice to play again
allow for wins to be recordedd along wwith win streak
